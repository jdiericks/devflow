# Page, Folder & Tree Rules

- Projects contain folders and pages in a nested structure
- Use a single `nodes` table with parent-child relationships
- Each node is either a 'folder' or a 'page'
- Pages link to a template_id and store values in a JSONB `data` field
- Nodes have a sort_order field for manual ordering
