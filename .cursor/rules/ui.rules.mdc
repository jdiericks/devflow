# UI Rules

- Use Vue 3 + Tailwind
- Include dynamic form component that renders based on template fields
- Sidebar navigation shows recursive tree of folders/pages
- Breadcrumb component shows current page path
- Page editor loads template definition and renders a form
- Auto-save form as user types
